# CSC 426 Project 3
# Authors: 
Lana Abdelmohsen, Luke Kurlandski, Gordon Petry, Jason Swick
# Description: 
A basic descision tree learning algorithm, capable of learning a tree from multiple data sources and producing a visual output.
# Content Guide
1. main.py 
- primarily for executing the code
- also contains a function to process input files
2. decision_tree.py 
- contains the DecisionTree class, which contains the ID3 algorithm, information gain, and entropy functions
- contains the Node class, which serves as the backbone for the DecisionTree class
3. tests.py
- contains unit tests for information gain and entropy
- tests for converting Node into a string
4. PlayTennisOutputTrace.txt
- contains string representation of the decision tree as it is being built for the PlayTennis task
5. Task4.csv
- contains our own input data for PlayTennis task for task 4
6. other .txt, .csv
- other files such as the project description etc.
# Instructions for Use
1. Compatibile with python 3.6.0. 
2. TCNJ HPC specific instructions:
- > module add python/3.6.0
3. To run the program:
- > python3 main.py input_path output_path
4. where
- input_path : name of a .csv file that contains training data 
  - may also be .txt file type, but must contain comma separated values
  - last column should be value of target attribute
- output_path : name of a .txt file to write the learned decision tree
  - NOTE: the decision tree is printed sideways, not vertically!
# Output
A sideways-printed decision tree will be output the the output_path supplied when running the program.
